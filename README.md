This repository hosts the implementation of a research project focused on identifying hate speech and offensive language in tweets. The project is designed to classify tweets into multiple categories, such as hate speech, offensive language, and neutral content, using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques.

The workflow involves preprocessing raw tweet data, employing feature extraction methods like TF-IDF and word embeddings, and applying various classification models. Both traditional machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest) and deep learning approaches (LSTM, GRU, BERT) are explored to achieve optimal performance.

The project emphasizes rigorous evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. It also provides visualizations to better understand data trends and model performance.

This work is aimed at facilitating the detection of harmful content on social media platforms, aiding in content moderation, and contributing to safer online communities. The repository is intended for researchers, developers, and organizations interested in tackling online abuse and promoting ethical AI practices.
